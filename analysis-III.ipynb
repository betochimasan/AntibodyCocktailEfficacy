    "Both methods of establishing binary confidence intervals are based on the Neyman “potential outcomes” model for causal inference, and one of the foundational assumptions of Neyman’s model non-interference, which means that outcomes of each event do not influence the other outcomes in the sample.\n",
    "Including the same subjects over a course of four weeks as different subjects for each week of treatment would inherently create four dependent data points per subject. This defeats the purpose of Neyman’s model, as the resulting outcomes matrix would no longer have an independent set of N subjects to evaluate against the treatment and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the inverse approach is taken, where the different weeks of treatment are seen as different treatments to measure against the control, this also has the same problem of interference, as the results of the same subjects to different dependent “treatments” will also be dependent, causing the underlying mathematical premise to fall apart."
