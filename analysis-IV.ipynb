    "Given the availability of the COVID-19 vaccines now in the US, we would like to know whether any studies have been conducted on the interactions between this prophylactic treatment and the vaccination for people who have already been vaccinated. The press release suggests that it may be beneficial for particularly high-risk individuals to have the antibody treatment as well as the vaccination, but given the restrictions on the Regeneron treatment for people already suffering COVID-19 symptoms or in need of oxygen support, we would want to know if having both treatments at the same time may have a negative effect for people at high risk for respiratory difficulties.\n",

    "The previous study indicating adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies and people on respiratory support from COVID-19 seems to be a study on Tocilizumab (DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2028700) conducted on people already in ICU care from COVID-19 symptoms, so it would also be beneficial to know whether this restriction is just for those on oxygen support as a result of COVID-19 or whether it also applies to people on oxygen support who do not test positive for COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "For unvaccinated individuals who do not already require respiratory support, though, we would recommend the Regeneron treatment, particularly if they are likely to come into contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19. The information on risk factors represented in the study, as exemplified above, could be more detailed, but the representation of different age ranges and racial/ethnic groups in the study appears sufficient to recommend the treatment generally without fear of adverse effects or less efficacy to certain individuals. The low risk balanced with the positive outcome of the trial suggests that this would be a helpful prophylactic to recommend."
